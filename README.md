avi index breaker

**tomato** is a python script and datamoshing kit for AVI files 
- utilities inspired by [Way Spurr-Chen](https://github.com/wayspurrchen)'s [moshy](https://github.com/wayspurrchen/moshy). 
- the way it works is based off of [Tomasz Sulej](https://github.com/tsulej)'s research on AVI file structure.
